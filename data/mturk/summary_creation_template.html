        <h1>Summary creation</h1>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>In this task, we will ask you to read a biography and provide a summary of that biography. 
        Your summary should be 2-5 sentences long, shorter than the biography, and it should contain the most important information from the biography. 
        It should be fluent, informative, and useful.
        <strong>Please read the entire biography</strong>, 
        even if you are already familiar with the person about whom the biography is written. 
        We are interested in your summary of the biography, not what you may already know about the person.</p> 
        
        <p>We assign 10 minutes to complete the assignment.
        The time allocation is based on average reading speeds and the cognitive load of the task.
        <strong>We will regard your answer as invalid if you complete the assignment in an 
        unreasonably short amount of time</strong>. The cut-off will be dependent on the length of the texts.</p>
        
        <p>We will also regard the task as incomplete if the summary is a replication of the biography 
        or if the summary is too long or too short. In these cases, you will not be paid.</p>
        
        <p>Afterwards, we will ask you four questions about who you are.
        If there are <strong>discrepancies</strong> in your answers to these demographic questions, 
        we will exclude you from the experiment, and you will not be paid.
        Likewise, if you leave a question unanswered, the task is incomplete, and you will not be paid for that task.</p>
        
        <p>You can complete as many summary creation tasks as you want. 
        You will be paid for the number of tasks you <strong>complete</strong>. 
    
        <p><strong>Please note that:</strong></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no advantage in answering the demographic questions in a certain way.</li>
                <li>We do not exclude people from completing the tasks based on their demographic information.</li>
                <li>We pay everyone equally independent of their demographic information.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
